## Key Takeaways

### 1. Container Selection Guidelines
- **Use `std::vector`** for random access, cache efficiency, and end-insertion
- **Use `std::list`** for frequent middle insertion/deletion
- **Use `std::deque`** for efficient front/back operations
- **Use `std::map`** for sorted associative data
- **Use `std::unordered_map`** for fast lookups without ordering

### 2. Memory Optimization Strategies
- Always `reserve()` when you know the final size
- Consider compact data structures for large datasets
- Use memory pools for frequent small allocations
- Structure data for cache-friendly access patterns
- Measure actual memory usage and performance

### 3. Iterator Design Principles
- Follow STL iterator requirements and conventions
- Implement proper iterator traits
- Test with STL algorithms for compatibility
- Consider iterator adapters for common patterns
- Design for composability and reusability

### 4. Custom Allocator Use Cases
